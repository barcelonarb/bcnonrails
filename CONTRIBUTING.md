# Contributing to Barcelona on Rails

Thanks for thinking of contributing to Barcelona on Rails! Whether you are here to report
issues or develop on the project the sections below provide
outlines on how to get started.

## Reporting Issues

Here's a quick list of things to consider before submitting an issue:

* Please [search for your issue before filing it: many bugs and improvements have already been reported](https://github.com/barcelonarb/bcnonrails/issues/search?q=)
* Write specifically what browser this is reported to be found in
* Write out the steps to replicate the error: when did it happen? What did you expect to happen? What happened instead?
* Please keep bug reports professional and straightforward: trust us, we share your dismay of software breaking.

And when in doubt, be over-descriptive of the bug and how you discovered it.

## Submitting Pull Requests

All pull requests should be proposed to the [master](https://github.com/barcelonarb/bcnonrails/tree/rails4) branch. The `master` branch is outdated.
